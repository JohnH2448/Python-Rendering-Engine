Terminal RGB rendering engine
- customizable dimensions
- customizable framerate
- pixel by pixel adjustment
- converts 2D coordinates to a 1D list
containing rgb values for every pixel
- reverse translator to convert 1D list
indexes to 2D coordinates if needed

Note: Attached basic engine and an example game
Any way to support higher pixels/s?
